# Misty
Code for Misty the robot

Based off of: https://github.com/CPsridharCP/MistySkills to make Misty run remoletly. I added my own features
to give Misty a personality. 


This code is the base for my PhD project. We are conducting Wizard of Oz Experiments to understand
how to make the conversation more natural and reciprocal. This work began as a tool for conversational 
therapy for older adults living with dementia; however, due to COVID-19, we have taken a step back
into the healthy older adult space. Through this work, we hope to develop guidelines on how to
develop social robots in multiple application spaces for the industry. 

Current versions include: findMisty.py, mistyTeleop.py, pyMisty.py, and streamLatestFrame.py. 

mistyTeleop.py displays the code I added to this project in order to give the robot a personalitly.
